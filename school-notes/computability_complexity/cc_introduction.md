There are 4 models of computation covered in this course
  1. [[fsa_home | Finite-State Automata]]
      - Algorithms w/ extremely limited memory.
      - Determinisitic and Nondeterministic Finite Automata (DFA, NFA)
      - Regular and Nonregular Automata
  2. [[pa_home | Pushdowns Automata]]
      - Algorithms w/ stack data structure.
      - Pushdown Automata (PDA).
      - Context-Free Grammars (CFG).
      - Converting PDA to CFG.
  3. [[tm_home | Turing Machines]]
      - The halting problem and undecidability.
  4. Polynomial-Time Algorithms
      - Computational complexity and NP-completeness.
