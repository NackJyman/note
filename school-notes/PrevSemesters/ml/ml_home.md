### Supervised Learning Methods
#### Regression
Regression is apart of Supervised Learning, Uber is an example of a company who uses regression to predict travel time and price.

Modules:
- [[linear_regression]]
- [[ridge_regression]]
- [[assessing_performance]]
- [[lasso_regression]]

#### Classification
Another form of Supervised Learning. Similar to Regression only the output isn't going to be numerical, but categorical. A good example would be spam filtering.

### Unsupervised Learning Methods
#### Clustering
Clustering is designed to discover groups of similar inputs. You would take the data and seperate it into disjoint sets. A good example of this would be of set images as an input and then the distribution of these images into catagories/clusters based on it's subject. Like grouping all the pictures of dogs together.
