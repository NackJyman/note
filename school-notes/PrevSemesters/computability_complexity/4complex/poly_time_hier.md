### The Hierarchy

The Polynomial-Time Hierarchy is a collection of complexity classes that sit about NP and coNP. It is an analogue to the Arithmetical Hierarchy.

### Collapse of the Hierarchy

The polynomial-time hierarchy is an infinite collection of classes. We believe that they are all distinct but no one has a proof. For example, if $P = PSPACE$, then $P = PH$. 

We say that the polynomial-time hierarchy collapses if there are only finitely many distinct classes. We say that it collapses to level $k$ if $PH = \Sigma_k^P$.

#### PH Collapse Conditions

>#### Lemma 
>###### For all $k \ge 1, \ \Sigma^P_k = \Pi_k^P \iff \Sigma^P_k = \Sigma^P_{k+1}$
