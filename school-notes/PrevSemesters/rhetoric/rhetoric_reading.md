### On Rehetoric: A Theory of Civic Discourse
###### Book 1
Aristotle defines dialectic (question and answer) as the art of philosophical disputation. Dialectic proceeds by question and answer, rhetoric does not do so. Dialectic is restricted by only speaking to logical arguements; while rhetoric includes the moral impression of the speaker and the emotions stirred in the audiance.
Rhetoric seeks a specific judgment.

Talk of not allowing off-topic speech in judicial contexts to avoid emotional persuasion rather than logical.

### The Poetics
###### - First Half
Part of Aristotle's theory on aesthetics

Types of Poetry:
1. Epic
2. Tragedy
3. Comedy
4. Dithyrambic Poetry

All poetry is a form of imitation:
- Medium
	- The Kind of art. A painter uses color as their medium.
- Object
	- This could be a person, place, or thing. Morally right or wrong.
- Mode
	- How the object is imitated. In a tragedy, through actors on a stage. In an epic, it is through narration.

#### Tragedy
Imitation of an admirable action that has *unity* and *magnitude*. Tragedy employs emotions in the audience, fear and pity through ***catharsis***.

```ad-abstract

Every tragic plot utilizes a *Change of fortune* which can be complex (*recognition* and *reversal*) or non complex.
