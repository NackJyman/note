# school-notes

These are my notes from School. At the moment I am currently working on this semester, but overtime I will add my previous courses. I wrote this all in Obsidian. If you want to look at it I recommend opening the folder "school-notes" as a vault in Obisidan.

Within each course directory there is a 'misc' folder that contains class powerpoints (if accessable) and diagrams used in modules.
